description: 'In his own life time Father Jarrett held a recognised position as the
  greatest preacher in Catholic England. In the light of his own teaching it is easy
  to understand the reason. Behind all his sermons there lay a personal vision and
  a personal love. He always preached to the individual: it made no difference to
  him whether these were many or were few. He would seem to put the same care and
  thought and vision into each of his sermons and his lectures for with him the lectures
  were in fact sermons. It appeared to make no difference whether these were to be
  delivered in Westminster Cathedral, or.'
